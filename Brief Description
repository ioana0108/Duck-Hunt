Duck Hunt C++, OpenGL

• Implemented a common ’shoot object’ 2D game in OpenGL using primitives.
• The program features a flying duck which bounces off the borders of the screen and which the player has to shoot
using the mouse to gather points. With every duck that escapes unshot the player ’life’ decreases and with every
other 3 ducks emerging on the screen their flying speed increases.
